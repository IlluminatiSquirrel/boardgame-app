# Boardgame App 

The end goal of this project is to create a much simpler version of https://boardgamegeek.com/ using it's public API and combine it with https://boardgameprices.co.uk/ public API to display best available UK prices. It is still a work in progress.

#### Implemented features:
* Displaying top 50 hottest boardgames along with their current pricing information 
* Adding/removing a boardgame to/from your wishlist (saving it to the cache at the moment, better storage medium to come later)

#### Features to be added in the future:
* Log in system
* Email notifications when a boardgame goes below user's set threshold certain price
* Adding/removing a boardgame to/from your collection
* Searching for a boardgame using the search bar at the top 

#### Preview of how it looks currently:
